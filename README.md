# vitamin_deficiency

This project aims to develop a deep learning model to detect vitamin deficiencies from medical images using AlexNet, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The goal is to create an efficient and accurate system that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing vitamin deficiencies, potentially leading to timely and appropriate treatment.
